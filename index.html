                <i>On the Individual: Metaphysics & Politics</i>, sets forth to synthesize Gilbert Simondon's concepts
                of individuation and transduction with Louis Althusser's general theory of subjectification and ideology,
                presenting a heuristic for viewing the developmental lineage of the individual from primordial physical
                process, upwards in complexity to the institutions which shaped its present form; the way in which the
                singular thing of the individual comes to be, how it becomes life, how it develops consciousness, and thus
                ideology--and how that ideology shapes the social relations in which the individual is embedded, which
                as I hope to present, is itself a process of individuation dependent upon its spatiotemporal contingencies
                as it develops.
                <br><br>
                More in depth definitions will follow, but for the moment this is to say: individuation (the process
                by which an individual comes into being as the partial resolution to an incompatibility or tension in a
                system), subjectification (the ends after which an individual in its development becomes aware of its
                separateness from its milieu--that is, an incompatibility with its milieu, or material environment: a
                subject), and ideology (the means by which an individual becomes a subject by way of the awareness of
                this <em>difference</em> from its milieu) are <em>universal</em> in that they are propelled by the same being, or process: the
                preindividual (the preconditional tension and self incompatibility that individuates all of reality--leaving
                behind its inherent tension and potentiality by way of inheritance to each subsequent individuation).
                <cite><sup>4</sup></cite>
                <br><br>
                This lineage of inherited complexity is always dependent upon spatiotemporally specific
                conditions which feedback on the process of individuation, subjectification, ideology, and ultimately
                <em>social relations and their institutional makeup</em>. This process of structuration (materially dependent
                historical unfolding) of a system is what Simondon calls transduction,<cite><sup>5</sup></cite>
                which is both a guiding analytical tool and formal organizational method for this text. In many ways,
                this work is to be understood as an individuation in progress; the transductive making sense of my
                reality; the partial resolution of an incompatibility; and thus, an attempt at developing a coherent
                ideology through which I will shape my reality.
                <br><br>
                Adding an additional conceptual heuristic, in <i>The Savage Anomaly</i>, by Antonio Negri, in his
                discussion of the development of Spinoza's metaphysics, presents two concepts: one is the <em>ascending
                path</em>, which "follow[s] the constitutive power of the collective imagination and its material density. The
                result of the process is not the absolute, nor even the democratic, but the collective constitution of
                reality";<cite><sup>6</sup></cite>
                the other is the </em>descending path</em>, which he uses to describe what he calls an inaccurate reading
                of Spinoza: instead of moving upwards from the constitutive force of reality towards the absolute, it
                descends downwards from the totality of substance to the constitutive force of the modes, constraining
                and limiting their potentiality.<cite><sup>7</sup></cite> While understanding the specifics of Spinoza's metaphysics is not
                important to the larger scope of the project,<cite><sup>8</sup></cite> I wish to slightly modify and implement these two concepts
                in what follows to help present the two modes of the individual as they exist in the world.
                <br><br>
                The ascending path--that of <em>the individual</em>--will be used to visualize this aforementioned
                transductive developmental lineage from what is called the preindividual upwards in complexity,
                presenting in this "path" of transduction what is in effect a universalizing, <em>collective individual</em>, the
                achievement of which being the true revolutionary subject of the universe. Constructing this being should
                be a unified planetary goal.
                <br><br>
                The descending path presents the opposite of this: a historically constructed, totalizing and
                singular path of subjecthood (<em>given</em>, not achieved) in the image of what I will refer to as <em>The Individual</em>: a
                subject divorced from its true functioning in the universe; rather than unified collectivity it perpetuates
                atomism and individual freedom; ultimately, in its mystifying inaccuracy, alienating the individual from
                the very constitutive force it needs to become unalienated. This is by way of the perpetuation of ideology,
                not by the individual, but in the <em>image</em> of The Individual through the present day result of millenia of
                societal structuration--that is, the State Apparatus (which in itself is understood to potentially exist along
                the ascending path, as opposed to its present iteration as a downward force of totalizing subjectification).
                <cite><sup>9</sup></cite>
                Destroying this path is imperative in order to adequately construct the ascending path.
                <br><br>
                What is presented below is a text in two parts: the first focusing on the universalizing way in
                which individuals come into existence via individuation, develop subjectivity through ideology, and how
                this development is shaped by the milieu or social order in which the individual is embedded--that is, not
                predetermined or the only possible outcome; followed by a discussion of the totalizing way in which the
                present outcome of this organization of society has alienated the subject to such a degree (via the
                institutional transmission of ideology by the ruling class in the image of The Individual by way of what
                Althusser calls the Ideological State Apparatuses)<cite><sup>10</sup></cite> that the resolution to this incompatibility is placed in
                arrested development. In the first half I will develop a metaphysical framework with which to understand
                the production of reality; in the second half I will cover specific historical events which have affected the
                transduction process of what is always already an individual, towards the false image of The Individual.
                <br><br>
                In sum, by way of discussing the various modes of existence of the individual, both in general
                and specifically in the present, I hope to present a case for universalism: that only once we have
                adequately universalized our collective ideology can we direct it downwards, totalizing the "collective
                imagination and its material density" back onto the individuals which propel it. In this way I believe that
                through metaphysics, we can present alternative political trajectories, or as Negri puts it:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                Politics itself is metaphysics. It is not a decorative addition, but the soul of metaphysics. Politics is the metaphysics of
                the imagination, the metaphysics of the human constitution of reality, the world. The truth lives in the world of the
                imagination; it is possible to have adequate ideas that are not exhaustive of reality but open to and constitutive of
                reality, which are intensively true; consciousness is constitutive; being is not only something found (not only a
                possession) but also activity, power; there is not only Nature, there is also second nature, nature of the proximate cause,
                constructed being.

                In order to study “the individual,” we must first analyze what it means to be an individual, or a
                “singular thing”--which is to say, analyzing the <em>process</em> of what Gilbert Simondon in <i>Genesis of the
                Individual</i> calls “individuation,” as they are one in the same (and are intended to be read as synonyms for
                the purpose of this text). In a word, individuation is the genesis of a singular thing; more specifically, it is
                the process by which an individual (living or physical/inert) comes into existence via “a partial and
                relative resolution manifested in a system that contains latent potentials and harbors a certain
                incompatibility with itself.”<cite><sup>4</sup></cite> It is through this resolution, or
                phase change as it may be conceived,<cite><sup>5</sup></cite> that
                novel singularities (singular things, individuals) come to be. Examples of a system simultaneously falling
                out of phase with itself, and resolving itself in the very act of falling out of phase can be found anywhere
                in the universe, and analyzed at any “level” of reality as a simple motor of ontogenesis,<cite><sup>6</sup></cite>
                be it an electron, a bacterium, a human individual, or society; all possess aspects of individuation functioning at varying
                degrees of complexity, levels, or phases.<cite><sup>7</sup></cite>
                <br><br>
                For example one may understand this at a lower level--or lower energy,<cite><sup>8</sup></cite>
                rather--as similar in description to a
                basic thermodynamic approach to systems biology, or even chemistry: viewing reality as
                a constellation of gradient reductions,<cite><sup>9</sup></cite> which evade full exhaustion
                but are nevertheless <em>productive</em>. This is the story of the origin of life on earth and shows how easily lower level
                phases individuate upward in complexity, or, how “the incompatibility within [an] unresolved system becomes [the] organizing
                dimension in its resolution.”<cite><sup>10</sup></cite> The individuation/speciation of a being learning
                to metabolize new gradients previously seen as toxic, as is the case with the process of biomineralization,
                <cite><sup>11</sup></cite> presents a "real
                life" example of this falling out of step with oneself, and resolving it in a productive manner that
                encapsulates individuation. This is the simplest, albeit helpful, understanding of the process, however it
                only analyzes a miniscule fraction of the whole concept; we must add an element of tension to our preexisting criteria
                of self-contained potential and incompatibility, and begin to think more abstractly.
                <br><br>
                A higher level/higher energy reading is needed when the aforementioned framework of
                incompatibility and potentials are expanded to encompass the “preindividual” being:<cite><sup>12</sup></cite>
                a meta-stable system which simultaneously has no phases, while containing within it all individuated phases in
                existence, together forming both the origin point and the sum total of reality, and thus <em>an inherent and
                productive self-contradiction within the system</em>.<cite><sup>13</sup></cite>
                This contradiction creates a perpetual tension, or element of instability in the system, in effect priming it for
                individuation if sufficiently
                pushed past a keypoint of incompatibility. Whereas the previous example used low energy physics, the inherent
                incompatibility of the preindividual requires the implementation of high energy physics more akin to the
                wave-particle duality of quantum mechanics to more clearly communicate that <em>to understand the
                preindividual is to understand the preconditions for individuation</em>. The similarities are noteworthy: the
                preindividual being demonstrates the superposition-like tension, potentialities, and self-difference of a
                quantum system in a state of meta-stable coherence--that is, it has not yet collapsed, and it remains
                outside of spacetime, “supersaturated” as a “wave” and a “particle” simultaneously (also read
                “individual” and “milieu”, “matter” and “energy”), rife with the infinite potential to collapse
                productively. The resolution by way of collapse of a quantum system is due to decoherence,<cite><sup>14</sup></cite>
                or disturbances within the system pushing it past a <em>key point of instability</em>. In the act of collapse, the
                quantum reality continues to exist and perpetuate physical reality; in many ways this is similar to the
                ontogenesis of individuation from the preindividual being due to the way in which the aforementioned
                tension, potential, and self-incompatibility are resolved, but not exhausted, via individuation.<cite><sup>15<sup></sup></sup></cite>
                This is to say, the preindividual lives on after individuation, both continuously as the preindividual and within every
                individuation ever by virtue of being the precondition for individuation.

                Now that the complex process of two separate regimes of individuation have been expounded on,
                regardless of which "spatial" level you are analyzing (high energy, low energy, or some admixture), the
                concept of time must now be implemented, as up until now only the moment of individuation and its
                preconditions have been discussed, and it is not only ontogenesis, but what happens as the individuation
                unfolds over time that is of importance to this project. To help illustrate this, Simondon uses (and returns
                to several times as a helpful heuristic for individuation) the process by which a supersaturated fluid
                crystallizes.<cite><sup>2</sup></cite>
                This “tautly extended and supersaturated system”<cite><sup>3</sup></cite>
                --tautly extended in that any significant disturbance my spur crystal individuation--can be understood as similar to the
                inherent contradiction within any individual or system in question, and the ensuing crystallization process is the
                cascade of partial resolutions. Simondon calls this immediate record of individuation “transduction”:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                This term denotes a process - <em>be it physical, biological, mental or social</em>- in which an activity gradually sets itself in
                motion, propagating within a given area, through a structuration of the different zones of the area over which it operates.
                Each region of the structure that is constituted in this way then serves to constitute the next one to such an extent that at
                the very time this structuration is effected there is a progressive modification taking place in tandem with it. The simplest
                image of the transductive process is furnished if one thinks of a crystal, beginning as a tiny seed, which grows and
                extends itself in all directions in its mother-water. Each layer of molecules that has already been constituted serves as the
                structuring basis for the layer that is being formed next, and the result is an amplifying reticular structure. The
                transductive process is thus an individuation in progress.<cite><sup>4</sup></cite>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                Transduction, as a visualization of the material historicity and responsive dynamism of reality,
                allows us to develop a spatiotemporally robust heuristic of ontogenesis as it develops over time and
                responds to its emergent tensions and contradictions. This process of becoming is present at every level of
                reality, not just in the formation of crystals, but also in the formation of everything from spacetime to
                human consciousness and reasoning; in this way it is universalizing: it brings in more preindividual nature
                as it unfolds. Transduction allows us to visualize this development of the preindividual, presenting its
                own genealogy as it propagates through the crystal, each new structuration inheriting varying degrees of
                the preindividual metastability without exhausting its potential,<cite><sup>5</sup></cite>
                thus allowing it to continue along the path of partial resolution in a series of incompatibilities--a bifurcation
                cascade of becoming.<cite><sup>6</sup></cite> In this way,
                if we imagine what might be called the primary transduction, or, the originary ontogenesis, unfolding and
                developing over time, inheriting more and more of the preindividual reality as it experiences phase
                change after phase change, reducing gradient after gradient only to be presented with more
                incompatibilities, we may begin to see what appears to be an individual being. This individual is the sum
                total of physical individuation: the collective individual; all of reality,<cite><sup>7</sup></cite>
                as it individuates itself as a collective unit.<cite><sup>8</sup></cite>

                Imagined differently, if instead of following the path of crystal formation as Simondon suggested,
                we followed the unfolding transduction of a Pythagoras tree fractal:<cite><sup>3</sup></cite>
                as you move upward from the first
                individuation (the largest square) we may imagine the continuation of a path of transduction, with each
                new phase inheriting ever more of the pre-individual potentialities and building a larger collective unit,
                spiraling continuously upward,<cite><sup>4</sup></cite>
                while every preceding step continues to exist independently of the
                collective at its respective “phase”; each element simultaneously retaining its own reality while
                constructing a larger aggregate.<cite><sup>5</sup></cite>
                (This heuristic is doubly effective, as the negative space, or milieu of the
                form is what dictates the parameters of the squares; much like with the interplay of the originary
                individual-milieu dyad, it is equally a component part and constitutive force of the total structure.) We
                may begin to imagine this fractal as a spiral staircase, an <em>ascending path</em> upward in complexity from the
                primary individuation. It is this sustained pathway of preindividual inheritance that universalizes the
                infinite potential and transductive capacities within every individual--physical, living, or otherwise.
                <br><br>
                What this means is the potential to further individuate is present in all of matter--to different
                degrees of intensity--or else nothing would have occurred in the first place. While it can be said that
                living beings perpetuate individuation inward in a way that physical matter cannot, the mere existence of
                living beings is proof of physical matter’s ability to follow paths of transduction which bring about phase
                changes from the physical to the living individual, as well as from the living individual to the conscious
                individual. This is the ascending path. It bears clarifying that at every point of development--even at the
                emergence of the first phase, all of reality is contained; it is suggested, rather, that as the ascending path
                develops, more of the preindividual is materially incorporated into the being, and novel singularities
                emerge which contain within them heretofore unseen levels of preindividual potentiality materially
                expressed at the level of their individuation, while continuing to individuate the potential of the collective
                individual.
                <br><br>
                As suggested, there reaches a point along the ascending path where in order to resolve an
                instability in the system (what we will discuss later to be an awareness of one’s milieu), the individuation
                gets retained inward, in an act of endosymbiosis no different than the joining of exogenous mitochondria
                with its host bacterium, or the acquisition of a holobiont's gut microbiota.<cite><sup>6</sup></cite>
                The resulting conscious“psychic being” can be conceptualized as the individuation of a central node in a line of communication
                between the pre-individual nexus of potentialities and the lower energy physical individuations of which
                it is composed.<cite><sup>7</sup></cite>
                (As we will discuss in a later section, the emergent self awareness and situatedness of the
                psychic being that consciousness necessitates--the interpretation of the aforementioned communication
                between levels--has effects on the successive transduction of that individual.) There is always already an
                “open dialogue” between all levels of physical reality in terms of information exchange, interrelation,
                aggregation, and individuation--however this dialogue does not exist in the preindividual itself.<cite><sup>8</sup></cite>
                This inability to interact across vast swaths of reality is the source of the contradiction at the heart of the
                preindividual, <em>which is the precondition for each successive phase change of structuration and
                communication</em>, bringing more and more preindividual into relation with physical reality, in effect
                producing more of the ascending path. This is what the psychic individual and psychic individuations are
                capable of.
                <br><br>
                The coexistence and interrelation of collective individuation and psychic individuation create
                what Simondon calls the “transindividual,” or “the systematic unity of internal individuation (psychic)
                and external individuation (collective)”; the transindividual allows us to conceptualize a collective
                psychic being, capable of responding to its perceived incompatibilities and maintaining metastability in
                its measured response. In this way, it is as if the concept of collective consciousness were merged with
                the natural teleological processes which construct reality, being revealed as one in the same process: that
                of the transductive pathway of the preindividual's sustained development over time as it resolves
                contradictions in the system.<cite><sup>9</sup></cite>
                <br><br>
                Developing this transindividual agency is a goal of constructing the ascending path. We will
                return to the transindividual below when we discuss the resultant alienation of subjectification by way of
                ideology later in this text, presenting an alternative to the totalizing descending path of “The Individual”
                as it is perpetuated by ideology in the present day manifestation of the inescapable subjectification
                process, striving instead towards a concept of the universalized transindividual subject.

                  I would now like to return to the simple low energy individuations with which I began, discussing
                their difference from the form of inward psychic individuation that was just discussed from the
                perspective of <em>control</em>. The ascending path again serves as a useful heuristic. Lower energy individuations
                will take place lower on the path, as they contain less of the inherited preindividual metastability within
                them and thus are easier to directly decode (i.e. such and such bacterium metabolizes such and such
                chemical). As you move upward along the path, the psychic being begins to be comprised of so many
                nested physical individuations that no one particular gradient can be said to have any one affect on the
                “host” individual.
                <br><br>
                These differences in complexity between psychic individuations and the comparably simple
                individuations of physical (and some "lower level" living) individuals are what make humans escape the
                realm of cybernetic control. <cite><sup>2</sup></cite> We are not a decodable array of
                metastabilities, but instead we address our
                problems, or incompatibilities, <em>mentally</em> via psychic individuation, as opposed to physically like a
                supersaturated fluid prior to crystallization. We may be born of the same process, but it is undeniable that
                the psychic being contains within it, as previously discussed, a sufficient amount of pre-individual nature
                to begin utilizing the process of individuation as a reasoning mechanism as opposed to a physical
                response mechanism.
                <br><br>
                To present an example of a physical response mechanism: NASA developed a specific frequency
                of near infrared (670nm) LED lamps for the purpose of growing plants in space. Near infrared light was
                used because it signals a response within the chloroplasts of plant's cells to flower larger and to elongate
                its growth.<cite><sup>3</sup></cite> It was later discovered that this same frequency of light,
                when exposed to human skin cells,
                signaled the mitochondria within the cells to repair the cell, in effect accelerating the healing process of
                the skin.<cite><sup>4</sup></cite>
                <br><br>
                Here we have two similar processes of individuation responding to an external informational
                stimulus--670nm LEDs--in a manner being conducted differently within each cell's specific biochemical
                makeup. One can not confidently say, "670nm red light means x", without including "for y," meaning that
                information is always processed in the present depending on the specific individual in question.<cite><sup>5</sup></cite>
                Interestingly, both of the organelles doing the responding are bacterial in origin, or what we would call a
                “low energy being”--debatably lower than the cells of which they comprise.<cite><sup>6</sup></cite>
                What this means is there are living individuals, within the living individuals of our cells, within the larger
                individual that is our self, responding to external stimulus in a cybernetic manner that has an influence upwards
                in levels of reality, <em>but only to a degree</em>.
                <br><br>
                The lights have an effect on our physical makeup in that they may accelerate our skin cell growth,
                but they do not control our psychic individuation in a way that goes beyond individually specific
                responses which are the result of a lifetime of permanent individuation creating subjective responses to
                red lights--that is to say, there is no universal control mechanism with humans and red light as there is
                with plant and skin cells; only <em>context dependent responses</em>.<cite><sup>7</sup></cite>
                The same difference in kind from lower
                level individual to lower level individual in their response to information is generally similar to the
                difference from psychic being to psychic being. What varies by what we might say species begins to vary
                by individual at the level of the psychic being, as there are simply too many processes containing the
                residue of the preindividual to successfully program or decode.
                <br><br>
                What we have been discussing--this process of expanding the purview of the sign relation and
                resultant <em>extra-mental interpretation</em>--that is, outside of (or "lower" than) the mind--positing that sign
                relations are instead pervasive, and function contextually on various levels of reality, at varying degrees
                of complexity, is what is called “biosemiotics,” and in many ways, it resonates very closely with the
                system we have already discussed as presented by Simondon and augmented by the ascending path: it
                posits that not only are sign relations not the creation of the human mind, but rather that <em>the mind itself is
                the creation of sign relations</em>.<cite><sup>8</sup></cite>
                <br><br>
                Signs in this instance are to be understood simply as something which comes to signify
                something "other than themselves."<cite><sup>9</sup></cite>
                The similarity of the self-incompatibility of the sign and the selfincompatibility of all individuals
                should not be lost on the reader. This is nearly identical to what was
                discussed previously in that the mind is achieved via nested extra-mental sign relations and
                individuations: sign relations are simply a response to an incompatibility--<em>a difference</em>; sign relations are
                individuations--a connecting link.<cite><sup>10</sup></cite>
                <br><br>
                Jakob von Uexkul, the 20th century founder of biosemiotics, once imagined that "[t]he meaning
                of the forest [could be] multiplied a thousandfold if its relationships [were] extended to animals, and not
                only limited to human beings"; to accomplish this extension, Uexkull envisioned a world in which each
                being is contained within a bubble-like umwelt, or "subjective universe."<cite><sup>11</sup></cite>
                This umwelt, "filled with the
                perceptions which it alone knows" can be conceptualized as the interface through which a being interacts
                with its world.<cite><sup>12</sup></cite> Only stimuli that correspond to a being's umwelt
                will penetrate this bubble of perception,
                provoking a sign relation--or interpretation--of some kind, the complexity of which is always determined
                by the material specificities of the being in question. This interpretation is of course much less “open
                ended” than that of a traditional human sign relation, but the sign, signifier, signified relationship of
                semiosis remains intact.
                <br><br>
                The most often used example when illustrating the umwelt is that of the tick, who has three
                simple response mechanisms within its umwelt: heat, scent, and moisture. The tick stands on the end of a
                piece of grass and waits for one of these stimuli, if the tick encounters something that has the capacity to
                affect its umwelt, it will leap off of the grass toward its stimulus, in effect resolving the emergent
                informational gradient. One can easily imagine a scenario in which this umwelt was exploited for the
                purpose of controlling a tick, or fooling it into jumping when there is no living being by simulating the
                specific temperature or olfactory triggers.
                <br><br>
                We may conceptualize this umwelt in scientific terms as the “degrees of freedom” of any given
                system. These are the parameters by which a system is governed and controlled. If we were to compare
                the three-dimensional (heat, moisture, scent) umwelt of a tick with that of a human, we would
                immediately see that the human has what may be considered <em>n-dimensional</em> degrees of freedom. This is to
                say, the number of physical individuations, as we saw with the near infrared light, that would need to be
                deduced in order to control a human is nearly infinite. The emergent psychic individual is far too complex
                to control in this manner--far from the biocomputer that was conceived of as programmable, and
                researched as so, for several decades. The ascending path again presents a visual of this developmental
                complexity where the lower energy individuations, <em>through their collective individuation</em>, pave the way
                for higher energy individuations that exist on levels of communication and interpretation different from
                them, while still belonging to the same collective whole.
                <br><br>
                In an upcoming section I will discuss in further detail the implications of this claim; how instead
                of futilely trying to program the individual, subjectification is far more effective at nudging the subject
                towards one specific goal: reproducing the existing mode of production and in effect the social relations.
                This subjectification process destroys the potentialities of the developed ascending path, instead
                constructing a totalizing descending path. Rather than programming individuals, it simply blocks certain
                aspects of the psychic individuation process of detecting the inconsistencies--the alienation--that it is in
                reality the false consciousness of ideology which reproduces them as subjects (abstract individuals),
                <cite><sup>13</sup></cite> as opposed to the universal consciousness of the pre-individual.
                <br><br>
                For this purpose, we will now shift our attention to ideology--the inevitable development in the
                collective transduction of the ascending path, and how it is utilized nefariously for the inevitable process
                of subjectification. The inevitability of the means (universal existence) should not be taken to suggest the
                inevitability of the ends (current conditions of subjectification), which, as we will discuss, are not the only
                possibility. Under the conditions of a fully expressed transindividual consciousness, there is no need for a
                totalizing descending path of false consciousness, but instead a constitutive ascending path towards a
                subject that truly reflects the individual of which it represents.

              <p>
                Up until this point, in an effort to instead focus on the individual, individuation and the
                primordial processes which propel them, I have only briefly discussed subjectivity, or the inevitable
                consequence of the aforementioned turning inward of the preindividual unfolding (the creation of the
                psychic—that is, conscious, being). This self awareness is the implementation of the human's
                preindividual inheritance of the individuation process. For example, Georg Lukacs describes a process
                called <em>teleological positing</em> as being that what separates human creation from the creation of, say, a
                beehive;<cite><sup>3</sup></cite> it can be described as the goal oriented reduction of
                mentally generated gradients.<cite><sup>4</sup></cite> This can be
                understood simply as the intentional (mental) <em>creation</em> and <em>implementation</em> of the inherited preindividual
                process of resolving incompatibilities which formed the (human) mind in the first place. In this way,
                subjectivity presents a cognitive phase change, shifting the resolution of incompatibilities from a purely
                physical response, to that of choice and problem solving.<cite><sup>5</sup></cite>
                Where subjectivity becomes productive for the
                scope of this project, is its role in making sense of the act of materially reproducing oneself and the
                material conditions which constrain and enable this act. I intend to argue that subjectification, just like
                individuation, is inevitable; however, just as the type of "individual" created by individuation is
                dependent on the unfolding of the path of transduction, as is the result of the process of subjectification.
                That is to say, <em>subjecthood is always spatiotemporally situated and produced by this emplacement.</em>
                <cite><sup>6</sup></cite>
                <br><br>
                First, it is worth mentioning the looming incompatibility (to be articulated in further detail in Part
                II) in my metaphysics as it unfolds, perhaps I may try to partially resolve it now, in an attempt to continue
                individuating my argument. The aforementioned "making sense of one's material conditions" does not
                exist in a vacuum, the human must be understood as a <em>social animal</em> "which can individuate itself only in
                the midst of society," and these societies are constantly changing.<cite><sup>7</sup></cite>
                Thus, in lieu of presenting an entire
                history of the unfolding of clans, families, societies, economies, the State, and their emergent class
                relations and modes of production, <em>at the very least</em> a survey of individuation and subjectification must
                account for the psychosocial domain (by which I mean the subjective human mind, the physical human
                body, and their always already embeddedness in the social--however that social structure is politically
                organized, i.e. the State) and the way in which the historically and regionally specific resolution of its
                incompatibilities organize psychic beings (individuals) into groups or classes; this process is itself
                transductive in its unfolding. That is, if all of history is a history of class struggles (conflict),
                <cite><sup>8</sup></cite> this is in
                effect a purely psychosocial read on our pre-established understanding of transduction and individuation:
                all of history--all of time itself--is the history of struggle in that it is the history of inherent
                incompatibilities of metastable systems and their partial resolutions.
                <br><br>
                What we have been discussing thus far is the material form of the <em>base</em>, what is necessary now is
                the ideological component of the subject, or the <em>superstructure</em>, <cite><sup>9</sup></cite>
                the combination of which forming the
                whole of the collective individual. Humans share the productive forces of the constitutive properties of
                physical matter, but contain more preindividual metastability (an ability to resolve an incompatibility
                without exhausting all potential energy), and thus exist on a higher level of reality, which ultimately
                determines the conditions within which the lower levels individuate themselves. In other words, the
                physical processes produce the psychic being, but in the last instance it is the "single thing" of the psychic
                being that is the milieu (or context) which sets <em>the conditions</em> of the individuations of their constitutive
                parts.
                <br >
                  Similarly, the social and its complex structurations--while composed of humans--exist on a higher
                level of reality, a level that is constructed and perpetuated by its lower levels (individuals), while
                simultaneously determining the conditions in which they reproduce themselves. These transductive
                psychosocial structurations, unfolding as the perceived resolution of incompatibilities in the mind of the
                historically and regionally specific psychosocial unit, form this history of society and the history of class
                struggle—the continuation of the ascending path. However, this is only part of the problem--to return to
                the aforementioned looming incompatibility: in certain cases, the transductive path is easily blocked by
                the very development of the psychosocial structurations of society, affecting the way in which the
                individual comes to understand the larger social whole of which it is a <em>subject</em>. This is all to say: in a way,
                at the present moment in history, the individual, subjected to the contexts of its larger social whole, is as
                constrained within subjecthood as a skin cell within the contexts of its larger human whole.
                <br><br>
                In the construction of regionally and historically (spatiotemporally) specific societies, their
                particular organization--both in their productive forces and relations of production--will necessitate
                individuals to individuate a worldview or "ideology"; this is the attempt of a psychosocial constituency to
                make sense of its milieu--of its determining social order. What this means is how the social order is
                organized will determine the clarity of the resulting worldview. In this way, it can be argued that specific
                ideologies have a history that is determined by their structuration.<cite><sup>10</sup></cite>
                However, this basic function of ideology, much like the basic function of individuation, does not account for the
                precondition of developing an ideology in the first place.
                <br><br>
                To once again zoom out before returning later in greater detail to the social, it can be argued that
                the genesis of the (subjective) psychic being was the genesis of ideology, an epiphenomenon of the
                individuation that necessitated the individual to make sense of its relationship with its surroundings--the
                individual-milieu dyad becomes the subject-object dyad in the individuation of ideology.<cite><sup>11</sup></cite>
                In this way ideology is eternal, in that there is nothing "outside" of ideology, it is omnipresent throughout history as
                being an individuation of the individuation of the individual itself.”<cite><sup>12</sup></cite> This is to say, ideology in general is
                eternal, but individual ideologies will manifest and develop in spatiotemporally specific ways.
                <br><br>
                As Louis Althusser says in <i>Ideology and the Ideological State Apparatuses</i>: ideology (in general)
                is simply "the imaginary relation of … individuals to the real relations in which they live."
                <cite><sup>13</sup></cite> Taken
                literally, this simply means ideology is the way in which humans come to understand the relation to their
                social structure, which will always be "imaginary", as it is based within the conscious mind, but as we set
                forth last section--and is similarly argued here by Althusser--in the last instance, ideas are articulated in
                the material, that is, by material processes, and in this way "<em>their existence is material</em>."
                <cite><sup>14</sup></cite> Thus, similar to
                how the human acts as a point of communication between two separate levels of reality (the preindividual
                and the physical individuations of matter), ideology is the relation between the human individual and the
                higher energy psychosocial dimension of social organization. This particular individuation is the creation
                of the subject: the individual which makes ideology real in its material enactment as a subject. In this
                way, the genesis of the psychic being is the genesis of the subject and ideology. Althusser calls this
                symbiotic relationship a double constitution
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                I say: the category of the subject is constitutive of all ideology, but at the same time and immediately I add that <em>the
                category of the subject is only constitutive of all ideology in so far as all ideology has the function (which defines it) of
                'constituting' concrete individuals as subjects</em>. In the interaction of this double constitution exists the functioning of all
                ideology, ideology being nothing but its functioning in the material forms of existence of that functioning.
                <cite><sup>15</sup></cite>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                In this way the subjectification of the individual, and thus the subject, is as eternal as ideology; it
                is omnipresent through human history as it coexists with the individual, <em>interpellating</em> them as subjects
                with ideology.<cite><sup>16</sup></cite> Althusser compares this interpellation to being hailed by a
                police officer in the street; they say “Hey, you there!” and in responding you have been interpellated.
                <cite><sup>17</sup></cite> As mentioned, the subject is
                simply the enactor of a line of communication (by way of ideology) between the human and its social
                relations, the human and its material conditions, the human and its milieu; understanding them as they
                develop together in tandem. This line of communication is one’s milieu saying “Hey, you there!” and the
                individual responding in kind.
                <br><br>
                In other words, as far as the inevitability of the genesis of the subject is concerned, it is to be
                understood as "the unity of the being when it is thought of as a living individual, and as a being that
                represents its activity to itself in the world both as an element and a dimension of the world."
                <cite><sup>18</sup></cite> In many
                ways, subjecthood--or the continuous process of subjectification (which always already also includes
                ideology) <em>acts as a mirror which reflects one's reality back to them</em>, showing them their simultaneous
                embeddedness and separation with their milieu. However, as with the difference between ideology in
                general and spatiotemporally specific ideologies, the subject has dual meaning: in general, it is the being
                ideologically becoming aware of its situatedness in the world, however, spatiotemporally specific
                ideologies and subjects (note respective pluralities) transductively develop <em>in tandem</em> due to the
                previously mentioned double constitution: ideology is how the subject is able to make sense of the world,
                and specific ideologies exist insofar as they are enacted materially by specific individuals which have
                been subjectified as subjects by a specific ideology; and specific ideologies are always determined in the
                last instance by historical and social formations which shape the resulting worldview.

                The mirror metaphor in the double constitution of the subject is important, because as we know,
                mirrors inherently distort to a degree, in that their image is always backwards, This slight distortion, in
                addition to what the mirror image reveals in the subject's simultaneous oneness and withoutness with the
                larger system, serves as the baseline incompatibility which drives the subject to transductively make sense
                of its place within the larger whole using teleological positing. Or in other words, as discussed above, the
                incompatibility is inevitable, it is part of preindividual inheritance and the motor through which
                individuation takes place; the incompatibility (inaccuracy) present in the mirror reflection is the
                precondition for the construction of ideology. It is one’s milieu behaving as a sign relation: at once
                reflecting itself, and something other than itself, yielding an interpretation of the sign.
                However, as we will discuss, the structure and presentation of this "mirror" will affect the subject's
                interpretation of the reflection and the ensuing transductive process of making sense of it. To describe
                how specific ideologies perpetuate, Althusser also uses a mirror metaphor; whereas in Simondon the
                individual inherits aspects of the preindividual through transduction, to Althusser the subject is
                interpellated in the image of a single <em>Absolute Subject</em>:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                "all ideology is centered, … the Absolute Subject occupies the unique place of the Centre, and interpellates around it the
                infinity of individuals into subjects in a double mirror-connexion such that it subjects the subjects to the Subject, while
                giving them in the Subject in which each subject can contemplate its own image.<cite><sup>2</sup></cite>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                This presents an interesting interplay between two "individuals": the preindividual of
                individuation, and the Absolute Subject of subjectification as they are folded into the construction of the
                psychic being; the ratio of which determining one’s ideological “accuracy.” As we move from what may
                be described as basic lower level examples of this process, we may begin to imagine how specific social
                orders will perpetuate specific forms of ideology, with the Absolute Subject serving various purposes of
                subjectification.
                <br><br>
                Let us assume the previous examples of the genesis of the subject exist at a point on the
                ascending path topologically "closer" to the genesis of the psychic being than where we are now
                regarding the structuration of a globally oriented society of States. If we were to follow along the
                ascending path as specific subjects and ideologies develop transductively--some spinning off of the
                ascending path of collective development, others being blocked by the conditions which shape the
                subjectification process, we may begin to imagine different scenarios of subjecthood. Whereas a mirror
                always already "distorts'' the image which it reflects, some instances of subjectification will more
                intensively distort the image of the subject and mystify it, alienating the individual from a subjecthood
                which in effect profanes its original being in the word. All ideologies are distorted in their reflection, this
                is the inherent incompatibility, <em>it is whether or not the subjectification process has rendered the subject
                capable of intuiting this incompatibility that is to be studied</em>.
                <br><br>
                For example, in societies where the ascending path (conscious collective flourishing) has been
                “blocked”, incompatibilities are mystified in such a way that it is not visible to the subjected individual;
                the system is unresolvable; the preindividual potentialities stifled in order to maintain class
                incompatibilities, in effect reproducing a system which is actively detrimental to the subject upon which it
                relies. In this instance, ideology can correctly be understood as "upside down" or worse; however, this is
                only the result of the spatiotemporally specific transduction process which led to the particular social
                structuration in question.<cite><sup>3</sup></cite>
                In the next section we will discuss how the Absolute Subject of <em>The Individual</em><cite><sup>4</sup></cite>
                is perpetuated by the psychosocial organizational order of the State Apparatus, the present day seemingly
                <em>immovable force</em> blocking the construction of ascending path, alienating subjects from their ability to
                truly make sense of the world.
                <br><br>
                First, I would like to re-emphasize that subjectification and ideology, like individuation, is
                inescapable. Just as the transductive path of individuation is dependent on its conditions so is the
                transductive path of subjectification. In this way, ideology does not have to exist upside down. If the
                desired ideology is to be imagined instead as a reflection of the preindividual of which the transindividual
                is ever increasingly incorporating, this goal will appear as a utopic incompatibility: a threshold which is
                unable to pass, but presents a constitutive and productive ascending pathway, and an incompatibility to
                partially resolve while developing and retaining the metastability of the system. The thermodynamic
                incompatibility of a hypothetical fully extended preindividual in <em>stable equilibrium</em>--as opposed to
                metastable equilibrium as previously discussed, is that in its genesis, it will exhaust <em>all of its
                potentialities</em>, finally reaching entropic heat death--the potentiality of which being one of the originary
                points of tension present in the preindividual to begin with.<cite><sup>5</sup></cite>
                This awareness of the potential to exhaust the
                preindividual can be seen as an awareness of the material constraints of a closed system, of the potential
                to exhaust resources, and of a manner of reproducing a collective transindividual aware of this scarcity,
                continuing what Lynn Margulis calls “the ancient struggle against thermodynamic equilibrium,”
                <em>collectively</em>.<cite><sup>6</sup></cite>
                <br><br>
                We must imagine closing the loop of reflection between the preindividual and the Absolute
                Subject making them one in the same, closing the metabolic rift of ideology and creating a circuit of
                subjectification and individuation which constructs the ascending path at the benefit of society. In such a
                transindividually centered society, incompatibilities would be immediately metabolized, gradients
                reduced productively at the benefit of the transindividual,<cite><sup>7</sup></cite>
                or as Marx described in <i>The German Ideology</i>:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
              Within communist society, the only society in which the genuine and free development of individuals ceases to be a mere
              phrase, this development is <em>determined precisely by the connection of individuals</em>, a connection which consists partly in
              the economic prerequisites and partly in <em>the necessary solidarity of the free development of all</em>, and, finally, in the
              <em>universal character of the activity of individuals on the basis of the existing productive forces.</em> <cite><sup>8</sup></cite>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                When I speak of the development of the ascending path, it is this free development for all that I
                speak of, not only of the human, but of the entire transindividual collective, utilizing the infinite
                potentialities of transduction to close metabolic rifts--both of energetic and ideological varieties. Whereas
                the original genesis of the subject simply reflected the subject's position in the world, it is the goal to
                build towards a transindividual subject which reflects back its preindividual origins, folding the fully
                expressed potentialities of the preindividual back into the material via the actions of the transindividual
                collective. In constructing the ascending path, our attempts to build individual consciousness from the
                ground up is always already superseded by the goals of the ruling class--which is where we will look
                next, in an attempt to better understand the methods of modern subjectification
                <br><br>
                As we move out of the realm of what truly constitutes a human individual: individuation,
                subjectification, and ideology <em>in general</em>, I would like to emphasize the goals of having spent the time
                doing so; this was ultimately intended to be a demonstration of: 1) the universalizing genealogy and
                potentialities of the "ascending path" that is the individuation process; 2) The dynamism and variance in
                expression of the universal process of individuation and transduction as it leads to various living and
                nonliving individuals; 3) a study of the effects of a particular individuation--that of the psychic being,
                which like the individual-milieu dyad before it produced the subject-object dyad, that of the self aware
                individuator understanding their world; and 4) discussing the similarities of the individuation process and
                the subjectification process, particularly its continuous unfolding and responsive development over time.
                Just as ideology is made material by the subject, the preindividual is made material by the individual, both
                of which contextually amalgamating to different degrees into a single being
                <br><br>
                Now that I have discussed the full preindividual potentiality of which we are an active participant
                and constituent, we must now view the ideological reality in which much of the world lives--the actual
                state of the ascending path, the unfortunate alienating potentialities of subjecthood made actual. This
                means turning our attention more intently to the modern apparatuses of "class society," or more
                specifically: of the growing capitalist global hegemony which interpellates individuals into subjects in the
                image of "The Individual" at ever increasing levels. This is where the totalizing <em>descending path</em> of
                subjecthood, as it is wielded by the ruling class to maintain--as opposed to resolve--social
                incompatibilities, is actualized to undermine the universalizing tendencies of the preindividual: the true
                animating force of the individual.

              <p>
                  Moving from the utopic potentialities of a theory of universality and collective becoming, we
                must now face the sobering incompatibilities of the present reality: an Absolute Subject which does not
                reflect the preindividual ontogenetic origin of the individual; in effect undermining its transductive
                ancestry, camouflaging glaring contradictions.
                <br><br>
                We may wonder what use there is in reflecting and perpetuating such a distorted image of the
                Subject; <i>In Ideology and the Ideological State Apparatus</i>, Louis Althusser argues that much like the
                equipment of a factory needing to be maintained and reproduced to continue functioning, so too do the
                subjects of a given system; this combined effort accounts for the continued reproduction of the productive
                forces of a society by the ruling class, and thus the system as a whole.<cite><sup>3</sup></cite>
                In this way it can be said that the
                subjectification process (much like individuation) is continuous, not a one time interpellation.
                <br><br>
                In order to achieve this continued reproduction of an alienated subject, severe modifications to
                the relations of production would have to take place, being subject production via ideology, as discussed
                earlier, is simply the individual's imaginary relation to the real relations in which it lives, and its
                imagination is in turn affected by its surroundings.<cite><sup>4</sup></cite>
                This would require the subject, in its making sense of
                the world, to develop the reflection of a Subject so distorted, that it mystifies the being's relationship to its
                relations of production, because <em>they are always relations of exploitation</em>.<cite><sup>5</sup></cite>
                If the individual were to be
                reflected its true conditions by The Subject, the incompatibilities would immediately be visible. This
                would increase the probability of a transductive unity being realized and a resultant class consciousness
                acting and responding to their world in unison--obviously not the desired outcome of the ruling class.
                <br><br>
                In this way it is crucial that the individual be engrossed at all times in an ideology which
                perpetuates the system; an ideology which conceals; an ideology which envelops the subject at every turn.
                This is the process by which the superstructure intervenes in and shapes the base;
                <cite><sup>6</sup></cite>the superstructure of
                the subject, by way of ideology, intervenes with the base of the individual, in turn modifying the being's
                ideological understanding of its being in the world.<cite><sup>7</sup></cite>
                <br><br>
                As previously mentioned, this phase change of ideology being turned inward against its
                constituents is similar to the phase change of the psychic being. Instead of the physical processes which
                comprise the psychic being simply being lone individuators, "making sense of their world" by reducing
                gradients which respond to their umwelt, they become part of a larger "social" whole which determines
                the limits of their existence--suddenly they are making sense of their environment as a means of
                continuing the function of their host psychic being. For example, my microbiome may play an active role
                in determining and maintaining my health as an individual, but in the last instance it is my decision
                whether or not to drink bleach.<cite><sup>8</sup></cite>
                <br><br>
                The subject in an exploitative class society functions similarly: it continues reproducing itself
                while consciously making sense of its environment--in so far as it exists to maintain the functioning of the
                system of which it is embedded; while ultimately it is the system itself which determines its conditions for
                reproduction. It follows, then, that particular societies, as they develop, certain individuations may occur
                which reframe and constrain the very act of making sense of one's world. In these societies, The Subject
                is given--it is not transduced, for the sole purpose of continuing the system; it is the <em>opposite</em> of the
                preindividual (as opposed to its reflection). This is the totalizing descending path which undermines the
                universality of individuation and subjectification: the current state of our world. It must function
                automatically, it must appear invisible--or better, those which perpetuate it, and those which are
                subjectified (which always become one in the same) must believe to exist <em>outside of ideology</em>; to be nonideological.
                <cite><sup>9</sup></cite>
                <br><br>
                It should be noted that this functions outside of outright coercion or violence--that is, physical
                repression. The subject must not be aware that they are being produced. What becomes necessary, then,
                are private institutions, or <em>apparatuses</em>, to help modify the way in which individuals make sense of the
                world as subjects, thus modifying the image of the Subject. To help understand this distinction, let us look
                once again to <i>Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses</i>, in which Althusser builds upon the preexisting
                concept of the State Apparatus (the means by which state power is enacted and thus maintained
                by the ruling class),<cite><sup>10</sup></cite> which was traditionally viewed simply as
                physically repressive in its function, by
                demonstrating the State Apparatus is composed not only of what he calls <em>The Repressive State Apparatus</em>:
                which functions by violence and is traditionally <em>public</em> (the army, the police, prisons, etc); but also the
                <em>Ideological State Apparatuses</em>, which function ideologically and are traditionally <em>private</em> (education,
                religion, politics, culture).<cite><sup>11</sup></cite>
                <br><br>
                The entire history of class struggle which produces the subject revolves around the wielding of
                state power, and it is through the comingling of both the Repressive and State Ideological Apparatuses
                that this is accomplished;<cite><sup>12</sup></cite> they are not always clearly delineated
                as we will see later.<cite><sup>13</sup></cite> The Ideological
                State Apparatuses serve as various modes of intervention between the superstructure and the base, they
                are designed not <em>to program</em> in the traditional cybernetic sensor, but to <em>nudge</em> individuals toward
                reproducing ideology, by making the very force which reproduces them as subject appear as outside of
                ideology, or rather, "just the way things are."<cite>14</cite> Where
                individuation is about resolving disparities,
                subjectification as it is enacted by the Ideological State Apparatuses <em>maintains</em> disparities that would
                otherwise reflect the subjects alienation back to them.
                <br><br>
                The disparity between the descriptive functioning of reality (the universality of the process of
                individuation we share with the universe; the way the universe actually functions) and the prescriptive
                form of reality (the separation of ideology from the control of individuals by the Ideological State
                Apparatuses; the universe as it is given) has been demonstrated; before getting into specific examples of
                the apparatuses which enact this incompatibility, I would like to spend a moment discussing the specific
                ideology in question, as it reflects "The Individual" as its Absolute Subject, and the characteristics of this
                subject.

                  Let me move straight on and see what happens to the ‘individuals’ who live in ideology, i.e. in a determinate (religious,
                  ethical, etc.) representation of the world whose imaginary distortion depends on their imaginary relation to their
                  conditions of existence, in other words, in the last instance, to the relations of production and to class relations.

                <blockquote>
                  Production by an isolated individual outside society ... is as much of an absurdity as is the development of language

                For The Individual to properly function, everyone in a society must be subjected to its image, not
                just the exploited.<cite><sup>3</sup></cite>
                In this way it is difficult to place the prime mover of The Individual. One may imagine
                the "making sense of the world" of early accumulators or capitalists some half millennia ago as the
                originators of this particular ideology; as the mode of production spread and they made their way into the
                ruling class, so did its ideology, morphing the imagination of all involved. While the ontogenesis of The
                Individual is impossible to locate spatiotemporally, and not functionally important, it was arguably born
                as early as the enlightenment, undoubtedly accelerated during the Cold War, further honed by
                Neoliberalism, and always functioned (and continues to function) within an apparatus.<cite><sup>4</sup></cite>
                (For the sake of this text we will be focusing on the historical period of mid-century America up until the present
                moment.) Currently, The Individual--that is, The Absolute Subject which interpellates individuals via the
                ruling class ideology of capitalism (Capital's very own "making sense of the world"), is poised and ready
                to continue to resolve any incompatibilities in its incredibly fragile and crisis laden system--<em>only insofar
                as the incompatibilities are inhibiting the continued functioning of the system</em>, rather than the increasing
                alienation of the concrete individuals which reproduce the system.
                <br><br>
                In this way, the Individual is incredibly talented at reducing gradients,<cite><sup>5</sup></cite>
                and has been doing so
                since its genesis, each crisis yielding a partial resolution which may temporarily resolve the crisis in the
                system, but always heightens the incompatibility and alienation of the working class, thus, the system
                itself. What is created in these purposeful gradient reductions is a larger and larger hidden gradient of
                alienation--these gradients are blocked by the Absolute Subject of The Individual. It should be our intent
                to make this gradient visible, to once again seize the means of subject production, this is the only way to
                build a transindividual subject capable of acting in unison to resolve its ambient incompatibilities. We
                will return to this topic soon, as it is not as simple as "changing people's minds," or individual action--for
                now, let us continue to unpack The Individual.
                <br><br>
                Instead of understanding the individual as set forth above, that is: 1) a universal process--not
                strictly a human; 2) comprised upwards and downwards in scale of more individuals; 3) not just the host
                and member of collectives of collectives, but embedded in a milieu--that is, not existing in a vacuum; and
                4) partially reconciliatory of the perceptible incompatibilities within the nexus of systems within which it
                is emplaced.
                <br><br>
                The Individual, as it interpellates subjects in its image is always human,<cite><sup>6</sup></cite>
                always isolated (from
                society and from its milieu--acting independent), always rational (maximizing utility and acting on all
                available information)<cite><sup>7</sup></cite>
                ; always free (to express themselves insofar as it maintains the system). This can
                be understood as <em>the logic of the system (ideology) made material and enacted via the concrete
                individual</em>, as these are qualities which both camouflage the alienation concrete individuals are
                experiencing in the world, and produce the means to continue reproducing the system. This is to be
                understood as a <em>continuous interpellation</em>,
                <cite><sup>8</sup></cite>
                beginning arguably before the individual's birth, to such a
                degree that depending on your level of subjectification, it could be argued that you are acting on behalf of
                the system, you are making flesh the invisible hand of the market, this is what Althusser means when he
                says subjects "work all by themselves."<cite><sup>9</sup></cite>
                <br><br>
                In the wake of all discussed previously in this text, the isolated human element of The Individual
                is an obvious inaccuracy: it Ptolemaically centers the individual, ignoring the milieu within which the
                being is emplaced and the individuals it constitutes and hosts, while normalizing atomism and isolation.
                This is not to say it isn’t a targeted vector of subjectification of The Individual;
                <cite><sup>10</sup></cite> but rather, for the
                purpose of this work, we can locate a more generative pairing at the intersection of The Individual <em>as it
                represents the physical embodiment of American capitalist ideology</em>, and the fact that this ideology is
                viewed as <em>rational</em>. It allows us to view the historical unfolding and development of this particular
                ideology over time, as elements of the system (and understanding of the system) began to instead reflect
                the core tenets of The Individual onto the concrete individuals it subjected. In other words, the ideological
                framework of neo-classical economists as they sought to understand the market, and military Operations
                Research specialists as they sought to better strategize decision making via game theory and cybernetics
                (as well as the attempt to correct the emergent incompatibilities within the ideology), synthesized in a
                way to shape not only the way in which the human is understood and reproduced, but the market and
                military industrial complex as well; thus The Individual; thus the individual.

              <p>
              I would now like to discuss one real world historical instance in which the Repressive State
              Apparatus and the Ideological State Apparatuses collaborated to perpetuate the ideology of The
              Individual insofar as it is a rational actor. To present a very brief and oversimplified developmental
              model, the origin and trajectory of this element of <em>maximizing utility</em> was born from the question of the
              determinant factor of value, which asked if the value of a commodity was in its production (labor) or in
              its usefulness (utility, satisfaction, derived pleasure)?<cite><sup>4</sup></cite>
              The answer to this question increasingly became
              the latter, dawning the age of the supply and demand curves and neo-classical economics, which appeared
              to accurately depict market mechanizations by imagining consumers as "rational individuals maximizing
              utility,"<cite><sup>5</sup></cite>--that is, behaving logically.
              <cite><sup>6</sup></cite> From here the invisible hand of the market is reified: if utility sets
              prices, and individuals always maximize utility, it should follow that the price is correct, the rational actor
              makes the market work <em>all by itself</em>. The concept of utility was later expanded to encompass
              probabilistically determined desired outcomes in an attempt to understand the process by which utility
              was calculated and maximized by the advent of game theory and the work of John von Neumann.<cite><sup>7</sup></cite>
              These theories were applied to economic and military interactions--as "markets and wars could equally be
              represented as games", or rather, zero-sum games. Actors in these scenarios are said to be acting
              rationally, responding to a situation logically with all available information.<cite><sup>8</sup></cite>
              <br><br>
              With both cases forwarding the very same premise, on one hand this creates a mathematized and
              probabilistic military playing field of human automatons calculating risk and desired outcome, setting the
              stage for World War II, the Cold War (and the resulting sphere of Individualized strategists and think
              tanks); on the other hand it presents us with the dawn of the <em>Neoliberal Individual</em> as championed by
              Milton Friedman: conscious and rational; awash in a sea of information; always already seeking
              maximum utility. With a few tweaks to von Neumann's theory of expected utility, Friedman and his ilk
              believed they could describe the way humans make economic decisions: not only do they maximize
              utility, "individuals behave <em>as if</em> they calculated and compared expected utility and <em>as if</em> they knew the
              odds.<cite><sup>9</sup></cite> It is at this juncture where an interesting revelation occurs:
              humans are in fact <em>not</em> rational actors,
              <em>never</em> have <em>all</em> available information, and thus, <em>don't</em> respond in the way in which these theories were
              predicting. This presented two problems (incompatibilities), which were "resolved" differently in each
              apparatus, military and economic, respectively.
              <br><br>
              Within the Repressive State Apparatus of the military, because these theories were developed in
              part for strategic military operations (which it should be stressed, the purpose of which were to uphold
              and reproduce growing American hegemony), as tensions grew before and during World War II, this role
              of The Individual as a rational actor calculating risk in the face of wartime conditions became crucial to
              uphold. The absence of this reflection of The Individual on the concrete individual was a glaring
              incompatibility--as we know, individuals never have all available information,
              <cite><sup>10</sup></cite> we simply respond to
              information <em>subjectively</em>. As opposed to correcting this assumption, instead it can be argued , as Hito
              Steyerl does in <i>Why Games, or, Can Art Workers Think</i>, that the computer (already in early development)
              would take the place of the absent subject, in effect extending the phenotype of the human to
              incorporate--and be incorporated within--computers:<cite><sup>11</sup></cite>
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              For Neumann, the computer is, so to speak, a rational game player. It is also a creative solution to the problem that the
              world didn't comply with the fictions of economists, strategists, and mathematicians. If adapting the model to reality was
              too difficult, one could always change the world according to the fiction. If there was no rational agents, why not create
              ones?<cite><sup>12</sup></cite>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              Within the economic Ideological State Apparatus, Friedman did not create an extension of the
              human to make his theory work, but instead (in a strange act of perfectly describing ideology) believed
              that theories were never supposed to be realistic in the first place--so long as they functioned accurately in
              predicting market machinations--the reasoning behind this is justified with an anecdote of a billiard
              player: despite being incapable of writing down the physics behind their shot selection, they behave as if
              they were aware.<cite><sup>13</sup></cite> This viewpoint would develop over time into the aforementioned Neoliberal
              Individual: the merging of market logic with human logic; shaping the development of economics and
              finance towards the "efficient market hypothesis," which is the market manifestation of The Individual as
              it interpellates not just humans but entire institutions in its image.
              <br><br>
              These incorrect models used for (militarily and economically) making sense of the world--that is,
              ideological models--despite their factual inaccuracies, joined forces and began to shape the very concept
              of what it means to be a human. The human-computer assemblage in its new rational capabilities, came to
              be enveloped within The Individual, maintaining their false rationality by association, while the
              inaccuracies of the human actor which enacted the "models" were set aside in favor of a functioning, yet
              highly abstract, model: an unresolved incompatibility. This transductive unfolding, in its models,
              implementation, phase changes, and development, serves as but one piece of the totalizing mirror which
              reflects an imaginary representation of the human's real relations back to them in the form of The
              Individual--the material enactment of the ideological form of American mid-century capitalism and
              beyond as it is shaped by its own imaginary understanding of its “real” relation to the world. Make no
              mistake, the computer is a useful tool, but it should not destroy what are believed to be qualities inherent
              to humanity.
              <br><br>
              At this point, it is possible that there may be confusion regarding any perceived similarities
              between the rational human maximizing utility and the transductive individual as it individuates.
              However, I would say that transduction falls on the opposite side of the original dispute over value which
              began this section: transduction is the process of labor producing value--the productive forces of material
              reality. Value is produced via the shared production of reality, as opposed to any particular perceived
              utility produced via individuation, as this would inevitably lead to an ontological privileging of certain
              "levels" which is not the goal of a transindividual unity. Additionally, the preindividual is anything but
              rational--its entire existence is precluded on an inherent incompatibility with itself, not rational stable
              equilibrium. In this way it should not be surprising that humans couldn't live up to their rational
              expectations, but the model was never intended to be true--just to reproduce the system. Once again, The
              Individual only reduces advantageous gradients, ironically in that way it manages to successfully
              maximizes utility, but only the utility of the system, while ignoring the incompatibilities within the social
              relations which perpetuate it, and the increasingly alienating Subject which interpellates on its behalf.
              <br><br>
              Interestingly enough, the realization that humans "do dumb things" did not lead to an
              abandonment of efficient market hypothesis, instead it lead to behavioral research dubbed "libertarian
              paternalism" in which the goal was to "nudge" the irrational actors towards rationality.
              <cite><sup>14</sup></cite> The Father in
              this instance is of course The Individual which serves the purpose of only one thing, reproducing the
              current social relations via the continued maintenance of market stability. In many ways, despite
              appearing late in the game compared to the rational actor, nudging--as I have previously described--can
              be conceived as the primary method of subjectification: the sum total of a life's worth of ideological
              steering. Next we will look at examples of this steering as it was conducted by the Central Intelligence
              Agency around the same time Milton Friedman was modifying John von Neumann's utility theory--but
              first, an interlude regarding <em>intention</em> in the reproduction of ideology

                  Despite the advent of the human-computer assemblage via military and economic ideological
                proliferation reifying the human's role as a rational actor, not only was the human not rational, even with
                its newly (imaginarily) extended phenotype, it was not programmable either. Nevertheless, the codevelopment of
                cybernetics as a method of understanding and controlling systems, and a heightening
                Cold War vying for ideological supremacy, led to a desire to win at any cost; which is to say, there were
                attempts made at direct subjectification--that is, mind control. During this time the human mind, along
                with most systems, were understood to behave cybernetically, or with determinate causality, just like the
                computers upon which we reflected The Individual, and those causal chains were attempted to be decoded
                with drugs and hypnosis in an attempt to program the human mind.<cite><sup>2</sup></cite>
                As discussed earlier, this is of course
                not possible due to the n-dimensional degrees of freedom of the human mind and all attempts were
                deemed failures, but what this goes to show is that the inaccurate models of The Individual reproduced all
                as subjects, not just the exploited,<cite><sup>3</sup></cite>
                and through continued subjectification by The Individual, they began
                to attempt to perpetuate the ideology at all costs. The ideology was in danger, and it needed the support of
                its institutional constituents in the apparatuses.
                <br><br>
                We must pause for a moment to reflect and understand that ideology as it circulates in class
                society serves numerous functions, all of which, as we discussed earlier, are conducted through a dual
                articulation of ideology only being constitutive of the subject insofar as the subject is also constitutive of
                ideology; what this means is: yes, ideology reproduces the subject, reproduces the institutions, and
                reproduces the subjects which reproduce the institutions, <em>but at the same time</em>, it is the institutions and
                subjects, via their material forms of existence which reproduce the (imaginary) ideology; ideology
                without a subject is nothing.<cite><sup>4</sup></cite>
                This is how the ideology makes sense of itself, through its material enaction
                by an apparatus--or more specifically: through a concrete individual's perpetual subjectification, the
                <em>ideological</em> practices of an apparatus or institution are enacted <em>materially</em>.
                <cite><sup>5</sup></cite> All of this is to say: the
                scientists, Operations Research specialists, Central Intelligence Agency operatives, and the "subjects" of
                their mind control experiments, were all subjected to the same ideology,<cite><sup>6</sup></cite>
                and in turn reproduced it to varying degrees.
                <br><br>
                One may wonder if those which experimented with mind control were consciously reproducing
                the ideology of The Individual, or simply functioning as a sufficiently subjectified Individual, and thus
                unconsciously (unintentionally) reproducing the ideology. Additionally, one might also wonder
                functionally what difference there is between mind control and the nudging which I have previously
                described. Ultimately, ruling class ideology functions with what might be described as <em>functional
                irrelevance</em>: the means may differ, but the ends remain the same.
                <br><br>
                In other words, despite plenty of efforts, direct mind control is far less efficient (and far more
                energy intensive) than a simple ideological nudge--or rather, the sum total of a lifetime of subjectification
                to The Individual, may be functionally indistinguishable from mind control. This is the <em>passive</em> (“nonrepressive”)
                form of coercion possible through ideology; the tried and true method.<cite><sup>7</sup></cite>
                You cannot program humans with determinate causality (x input = y output); however, as mentioned, you can nudge towards a
                goal. That goal of course being the continued reproduction of the system:<cite><sup>8</sup></cite>
                the social, political, and
                economic organization as it is expressed through the material existence of concrete individuals in the
                image of The Individual. So in this way perhaps mind control was a success after all, just through wildly
                different means than traditionally understood, or in other words: despite our inability to be programmed
                as such, <em>functionally, subjectification and mind control are indistinguishable</em>.
                <br><br>
                I would like to discuss one way in which this ideological nudging, or pseudo mind control, was
                conducted by way of the intentional (purposeful) and covert amplification of the nascent-but-not-yet-by
                any-means dominant painting style of Abstract Expressionism by the Central Intelligence Agency and its
                private interlocutors. Once again demonstrating an intersection of the Repressive State Apparatus and the
                Ideological State Apparatuses, this time the Cultural Ideological State Apparatus. Furthermore, this also
                demonstrates the functional irrelevance of the incognizant painter, unconsciously becoming the avatar
                through which The Individual began its ideologically orchestrated world tour.

              As previously mentioned, one of the defining characteristics of The Individual is freedom:
              freedom to consume; freedom to express; freedom to maximize utility; freedom to be an Individual. This
              line of subjectification should be understood as a <em>negative freedom</em>, that is, the freedom from outside
              interference of individuals, collectives, or institutions (i.e. the State).<cite><sup>3</sup></cite>
              The irony in this of course being
              that the invisibility of the particular ideology in question allows it to reproduce subjects in the image of
              The Individual under the guise of it being one's own volition;<cite><sup>4</sup></cite>
              in expressing oneself within the
              predetermined degrees of freedom given by ruling class as it wields state power via the State Apparatuses,
              you are somehow demonstrating freedom. This is of course wildly different from the freedom which
              comes from individuation, in which freedom is considered "the form of the singularity … insofar as it is
              the practical essence of the mind, insofar as it is the capacity to construct being. The mind and the will,
              intuition and freedom."<cite><sup>5</sup></cite> Or that is, insofar as it is the constitutive
              force of reality; the freedom to productively individuate oneself, one's mind, one's society, one’s
              institutions--collectively: <em>positive freedom</em>.
              <br><br>
              It must be understood that even with the full stoppage of the ascending path insofar as it
              represents the sum total of reality's flourishing, transduction still takes place; it is universal. It should then
              follow that the unfolding of ideology is still dependent on the spatiotemporally specific structuration of its
              milieu. In this way, we can imagine the transduction process, revealing in its unfolding, new ways of The
              Individual to make sense of its milieu, presenting potentially useful tools to its apparatuses to amplify.
              <br><br>
              I am talking in this instance about how the global sociopolitical tensions of mid-century
              America<cite><sup>6</sup></cite>
              --the same conditions which turned humans into computers--presented to the CIA the newly
              developing style of Abstract Expressionism--ripe with ideological potential. As described by Frances
              Stonor Saunders in <i>The Cultural Cold War: The CIA and the World of Arts and Letters</i>, “[the paintings]
              spoke to a specifically anti-Communist ideology, the ideology of <em>freedom</em>, of <em>free enterprise</em>.
              <em>Nonfigurative and politically silent</em>, it was the very antithesis to socialist realism. It was precisely the kind
              of art the Soviets loved to hate.”<cite><sup>7</sup></cite>
              Thus, not only was this a chance to continue reproducing The Individual
              domestically, but to present The Individual against a competing global force in an attempt to, “to create a
              world after its own image.”<cite><sup>8</sup></cite>
              Whereas the Rational Individual was reified through abstract models of
              economics, warfare, and mathematical probability, it was the hope of the CIA to reify the rugged and free
              qualities of the Individual by the proliferation of abstract (an imagined relation divorced from reality)
              models of American “expression” insofar as expression is an isolated act of personal negative freedom:
              <em>Libertarian Expressionism</em>.
              <br><br>
              Thus, within this genre of painting contained the potential to present a cultural antithesis to the
              socially minded, reality depicting iterations of Soviet and Chinese socialist realism.<cite><sup>9</sup></cite>
              However, unfortunately for the CIA, most politicians in America viewed <em>all</em> modern art as "communistic,"
              <cite><sup>10</sup></cite> even
              Abstract Expressionism, and thus a lost cause with little hope of public funding or political support; with
              Clement Greenberg going as far as claiming art had been “abandoned by those to whom it actually
              belongs—our ruling class.”<cite><sup>11</sup></cite> At this moment in history it was crucial
              to transform the United States into a
              cultural hub of the world, in effect shifting the transduction of modernism towards American dominance,
              but a lack of public support led the CIA to seek help from private donors and the cultural ISAs. The
              poorly organized assemblage of Abstract Expressionist painters were about to receive large sums of
              capital and a CIA spotlight “two or three removed” to <em>make material</em> in their paintings and reflect in their
              persona the ideological <em>image</em> of Individual.<cite><sup>12</sup></cite>
              <br><br>
              With a combination of efforts including hosting overseas American Painting exhibitions; the
              continued praise of anti-communist tastemaker art critics like Clement Greenberg; clandestine donations
              from the CIA itself; and courting the assistance of the Museum of Modern Art and Nelson Rockefeller
              (the son of Abby Aldrich Rockefeller: MoMA co-founder--Nelson called it "mommy's museum), who
              referred to Abstract Expressionist paintings as "free enterprise paintings" and supported the movement
              both by adding upwards of 2,500 paintings to his private collection and distributing thousands more to
              various Rockefeller owned businesses;<cite><sup>13</sup></cite> these artists received
              the capital to not only reproduce
              themselves--the most crucial requirement of survival, but to consistently reproduce the image of The
              Individual by way of the development of their body of work on a global stage.
              <br><br>
              Thus, it can be said that Abstract Expressionism--debatably the most noteworthy trend in
              American art outside of the walled garden of the institution--and its subsequent place within the canon,
              was undoubtedly nudged towards success by the collaboration of the Repressive State Apparatus and the
              Ideological State Apparatuses. Without the monetary support by way of intentional ideological
              amplification, it is impossible to say for sure if Jackson Pollock would be a household name. This
              inevitably leads the author to wonder what other forms of culture which demonstrate qualities of The
              Individual have been purposely amplified,<cite><sup>14</sup></cite> and if there is any
              functional difference from their intended amplification, and the proper functioning of the system in general.
              <br><br>
              Located at the transductive unfolding of the present, it is nearly impossible to imagine the CIA
              targeting the art world in its present state of development. No longer is it on the world stage, no longer
              does it pose any inherent threat to the system, no longer is there an emergent foreign art genre in need to
              juxtapose. The mission of the coercive nature of art has been completed, there is no longer any generative
              use in its implementation by the Ideoligcal State Apparatuses insofar as it has internalized the goals of the
              project into the canon, and thus much of the ideology of the institution and successive generations of
              students. Given our current historical specificities, rather than visual art being seen as the most efficient
              vector for perpetrating The Individual culturally, as was the case with Abstract Expressionist painting--
              which, with its limited degrees of freedom was intended to nudge the viewer towards self reflection,
              rationality, freedom to consume and to express; if there were to be a promising vector of ideological
              transmission ripe for a similar co-option, memes are far more likely to be a site of present day propaganda
              than art.
              <br><br>
              Thus, unsurprisingly, starting in the mid-2000s DARPA (the present day transductive location of
              one of the founding apparatuses of the internet) funded research into the possibilities of implementing
              internet memes to do just that.<cite><sup>15</sup></cite> It should be noted that in the
              mid-2000's, much like the abstract
              expressionists in the early days of their attention from the CIA, memes were not clearly established as a
              cultural force of communication, and somewhat fringe. Viewing the current state of internet memes
              presents an ideologically rich genre of information dissemination, from the abstract and irreverent, to
              didactic--often times a blurring of the two. Again, it is impossible to determine if DARPA's research into
              implementing meme's as a method of control was successful, but they have debatably reshaped the
              current state of culture in a way that out shadows anything Abstract Expressionism ever did, and thus
              remain as a potentially rich vector for ideological transmission, be it radicalization, ironic detachment, or
              similar inward gazing as with the drive to unplug from society present in the mid-twentieth century.
              Perhaps in the future, the true nature of DARPA's involvement (like the CIA in Abstract Expressionism),
              or lack of involvement will be revealed, but for now the distinction remains functionally irrelevant.

                The Ideological State Apparatuses, as set forth by Louis Althusser, present a helpful advancement
                in the theory of the State, a theory of ideology <em>in general</em>, and the concept of subjectification; I would like
                to propose a further descriptive development towards what might be called the <em>Extra-State Apparatus</em>,
                <cite><sup>3</sup></cite>
                which functions with the same purpose as the State Apparatus--the active wielding of State power by the
                ruling class in the continued domination over the working class via the State Apparatus--but has found a
                way to transcend individual states, presenting instead a steadily growing global apparatus. The
                subjectification process of The Individual, by way of the historical events discussed above, as well as
                countless others, have been so successful that it has been ported to countries around the world in such a
                way that it is difficult to say if, for example, Amazon functions as an element of simply the United States
                ISAs or a new larger entity, which yields Extra-State power.
                <br><br>
                This <em>intentional megastructure</em> of the Extra-State Apparatus is comprised of its own repressive
                and ideological wings,<cite><sup>4</sup></cite> each containing within it various
                states perpetuating what is in effect the same
                ideology. I simply wish to alter the theory to acknowledge that The Individual is no longer only an
                American concept. After the fall of the Sovier Union, the war for ideological dominance ended; no longer
                was the United States operating domestically and overseas to stop the threat of communism, and yet, the
                desire to spread American Democracy continued--and this democracy always already requires a political
                constituency of Individuals to properly function and reproduce itself; and thus The Individual becomes a
                global citizen.
                <br><br>
                In any event, this descriptive update to match the current state of global monopoly capitalism will
                not require any further modification to the theory, it is only to acknowledge the co-evolution of an
                <em>ideological</em> monopoly in the efficient marketplace of ideas. It should be understood that this growing
                tendency towards centralization both of capital and of the ideological apparatuses which aid in its
                proliferation presents a growing incompatibility in dire need of resolution. The wielding of the Extra
                State Apparatus by a global transindividual subject acting in unison towards the "solidarity of the free
                development of all";<cite><sup>5</sup></cite>
                this is what I have been evoking all along in discussing individuation, subject
                production and universality.
                <br><br>
                In building the ascending path you are constructing a form of global consciousness. The
                individual is powerless in isolation and can only ever reduce the incompatibilities of the present by
                activating a global transindividual unity to overcome the ever increasing rift in subjectification. Only once
                the ascending path has incorporated as much into its expanse as possible--<em>including the apparatuses
                themselves</em>--will the deftly mystified incompatibilities present within The Individual become visible.
                Totalization, that is, State Power, can only ever be properly wielded <em>after</em> adequate universalization. The
                descending path of the Extra-State Apparatus is purely totalizing, with no constitutive force of the
                preindividual animating it. In order to close the rift of subjectification (the gap between the preindividual
                constitutive force and the present day image of subjectification in The Individual) we must strive first
                towards constructing the ascending path, that is, discovering, acknowledging, and <em>materially enacting</em> our
                shared primordial constitutive potentiality before developing any hope of a truly reflective Absolute
                Subject: the preindividual; creating a closed circuit between being and consciousness.

                  A privileged place, a place that has a power, is one that drains from within itself all the force and efficacy of the

                  impenetrable part of the woods is where all its reality resides. The magical world is thus made of a network of places
                  and of things that have a power and that are bound to other things and other places that also have a power. This path,
                  this enclosure, ... contains all the force of the land, the key-point of the reality and the spontaneity of things, as well as

                The images contained within this text are all processed with what is called "error diffusion"
                dithering. In short: it is an algorithmic process for converting color images, into 1 bit--that is, black and
                white--images.<cite><sup>2</sup></cite>
                The process scans the source image line by line, pixel by pixel; as the algorithm arrives at
                a pixel, it analyzes its value compared to 50% grey. If the pixel is under 50% it turns black, if it is over
                50% it turns white. The percentage amount by which the analyzed pixel is over or under 50% is
                considered an "error" (incompatibility) which must be "diffused" (individuated) to the neighboring pixels.
                The way in which this error is diffused varies from algorithm to algorithm, but conceptually they remain
                the same. In this way, the processing of the inherent incompatibilities within the source image, by way of
                each individual pixel, is partially resolved in the distribution of this incompatibility to its neighboring
                pixels. Depending on the compositional makeup of the source image, this process has the potential to
                individuate novel emergent singularities and transduction patterns within the resulting error diffusion, in
                effect producing what can be considered individuals composed of individual pixels within the self
                contained (pre)individual source image.
                <br><br>
                Alternatively, if there were no "errors,"--that is, if the source image itself was a "rational" 50%
                grey, the resulting image would be a perfectly ordered checkerboard pattern,
                <cite><sup>3</sup></cite> or in other words, stable
                equilibrium--entropic heat death. What is required for novel singularities to express themselves within
                the error diffusion process is an individual source image with sufficient incompatibilities at the level of
                the individual pixel to yield these novel patterns by way of the diffusion of errors--that is, the process of
                partially resolving incompatibilities within a system. Every individuation, every transduction, is
                dependent upon the initial conditions of not only the system from which it was individuated, but the
                preindividual from which the entire process emerged. The preindividual is reflected in the image of the
                completed error diffusion--never fully, as that is impossible, but sufficiently to produce generative
                transductions. We must strive to build a societal source image which produces these complex
                transductions and novel singularities that demonstrate the shared composition of reality within which we
                are all embedded. We must diffuse errors productively, avoiding the checkerboard of stable equilibrium,
                while altering the conditions which distort the integrity of the source image of the preindividual. Let us
                make a perfect picture.

                  As a flat ontologist, I believe <i>all things</i> contain within them equal levels of existence and constitutive potential. It pains me to use terms such as “lower level” when referring to <i>beings</i>, as I believe all of reality exists on the same “plane”--that is, horizontally in terms of being. Please rest assured the writer is speaking in terms of lower energy levels as is commonly used when describing different types of physics, with lower energy levels generally being understood as easier to predict than higher energy quantum systems. Ultimately, it isn’t a difference of level per se, but that of <i>modality</i>, or the way in which the level expresses itself. See Crowther, "Emergence and Reduction." for an interesting discussion on “levels” of reality via Effective Field Theory.

                  Temperature gradients; pressure gradients; these are differences which naturally dissipate--that is, neutralize. To reduce a gradient is to reduce an incompatibility or difference within oneself or within a system. As we will discuss, not all gradients reduce entirely, some reduce partially and productively; this is the realm of individuation.

See entire article for discussion of decoherence and coherence as they relate to the quantum wave function, as well as their larger relation to the possibility of quantum states being generated by way of sustained coherence of the wave function within cytoskeletal microtubules inside neurons--which is posited may be the physical process through which human consciousness is generated, as opposed to existing outside of the mind. Presenting a strangely materialist view on the neurological shielding of the wave function in “warm, wet, and noisy” conditions of the human brain, when traditionally they are only thought to exist in a vaccuum. This shielding of the wave function by life processes--that is, individuation processes--as a means of turning inward the quantum potentialities of the universe as a mode of reasoning served as a major point of inspiration for this text.

                  Simondon, <i>Technical Objects</i>, 177. “Those which precisely manifest the greatest spontaneity of organization, are systems of metastable equilibrium; the discovery of a structure is indeed at the very least a provisional resolution of incompatibilities, but it is not the destruction of potentials; the system continues to live and evolve; it is not degraded by the emergence of structure; it remains under tension and capable of modifying itself.”

                  Ibid., 314. In many ways, all of what has been discussed in this section, in the opinion of the author, does not differ from ideas advanced by historical materialism and the dialectic, and will be used for similar purposes, the only difference in the mind of Simondon is:
                  "the process of individuation does not seem to correspond to the appearance of the negation that follows as the second step, but rather to an immanence of the negative in the primary state, the precondition for what follows, in the ambivalent form of tension and of incompatibility." (Simondon 1992, 314)
                  Processes still "produce their own gravediggers," (Marx and Engels (1888) 1992, 26) however the gravediggers are a precondition of the process, not an effect. If anything it is a development and expansion of the existing framework, and does not rule out its implementation in the construction of class politics as will be discussed later.

This helps illustrate the transductive development of the human mind in comparison to the "extra-mental" sign relations of the aforementioned bacterial organelles, while demonstrating their interconnectedness. (The variance in sign interpretation that comes from the phase change to psychic beings can be said to create subjectivity, which, as we will discuss later, affects the resulting transduction path of the individual.)

The beehive example from capital has long served as a point of contention for me, I believed it to present an example of an overly mechanistic bee, and in some ways it may. Many of the scientific theories which undermine the mechanistic view of biology have emerged relatively recently in comparison to the quote in question, which locates the view in history. If anything, this shows the variety of what may be considered “subjective” behavior in nature: what is making a beehive if not “making sense of” one’s environment? This should hopefully present even more wonder to the reader to ponder; what separates the human mind from that of a bee; what processes of individuation do we contain that they don’t; how can we further build an understanding of this mutual constitutive force which reproduces both the bee and the human--and everything.

Neither conscious purpose nor natural selection is required to account for perceived “purposeful” processes such as thermoregulation”; cf. Simondon, "Genesis of the Individual," 301-02. “Stable equilibrium excludes the idea of becoming because it corresponds to the lowest level of potential energy possible; it is the sort of equilibrium that is attained in a system when all the possible transformations have been achieved and no other force remains to enact any further changes. With all the potentials actualized, and the system having reached its lowest energy level, it can no longer go through any more transformations.”

                  This information gap which limited the human's rational potential was not viewed as indicative of a failed heuristic, but instead just that--a lack of information, that is, easily resolvable with more information. With enough information, it doesn't matter if your models are wrong. (Steyerl 2017, 160-61) This forms the unity of utility theory and data science. "The individual is still rational, we simply must acquire more information to further tune this rationality.” “The market reflects the true price value, we simply must acquire more information to further tune this accuracy." This is not to say the collection of data in general is dangerous, certainly there are instances in which it would be beneficial if properly implemented for the purposes of a unified global transindividual flourishing. (Phillips and Razworski 2019, 211-13) However, it is simply a fact that under the current social order, data collection is always used to perpetuate the system by means of it being easier to predict, model, and in effect control, thus serving as another ideological node of The Individual as it makes sense of its world by way of the narrative arc set forth by the genesis of the rational actor maximizing utility.

If this interpretation is right, the lake may be regarded as a huge extended phenotype, extending the foraging range of the beaver in a way which is somewhat analogous to the web of the spider..” Ironically, this concept of the extended pheontype--and many of Dawkins’ theories, described differently, present a world in which all organisms consciously maximize utility.

                  For an official U.S. military strategist presentation of the tactical potential and applications of PSYOP or Psychological Operations internationally, see Goldstein and Jacobowitz, "Psychological Operations." 5.  “PSYOP is a vital element within the broad range of US political, military, economic,and ideological actions. Properly employed, PSYOP reduces the morale and combat efficiency of enemy troops and creates dissidence and disaffection within their ranks. Psychological operations can promote resistance within a civilian populace against a hostile regime or be employed to enhance the image of a legitimate government. The ultimate objective ofAmerican PSYOP is to convince enemy,friendly, and neutral nations and forces to take action favorable to the US and its allies.” Again this shows the interplay between the Repressive and Ideological wings of the State Apparatuses, and presents the active interest shown in nudging subjects towards compliance.

                  Althusser, "Ideological State Apparatuses," 245. “Given the fact that the ‘ruling class’ in principle holds State power (openly or more often by means of alliances between classes or class fractions), and therefore has at its disposal the (Repressive) State Apparatus, we can accept the fact that this same ruling class is active in the Ideological State Apparatuses insofar as it is ultimately the ruling ideology which is realized in the Ideological State Apparatuses.”

                  Additionally, there were established leftist painters in Latin America, with which some Abstract Expressionists had prior contact. For an anecdote regarding a failed attempt at Nelson Rockefeller interpellating Diego Rivera as an avatar of The Individual see Saunders, Cultural Cold War, 217. After failing to remove what appeared to be Vladamir Lenin from a commissioned mural at the Rockefeller Center (the Rockefeller’s believed in the ability to convert leftist artists with patronage) Rivera was paid in full, and the mural was destroyed with jackhammers.

                  Saunders, <i>Cultural Cold War</i>, 212. “America, whilst advocating freedom of expression abroad, seemed to begrudge such freedoms at home.” For a similar incompatibility see Beck and Bishop, <i>Technocrats of the Imagination</i>, 4. “[W]hile individual freedom remained the bedrock of democratic virtue, the complexity of modern society increasingly required expert organization and management according to rational principles.” The stark incompatibilities between ideology and reality were apparent to some, which still managed to nevertheless perpetuate it. Also contained in Beck and Bishop, <i>Technocrats of the Imagination</i>, is a discussion of a different artist trajectory during the cold war, yielding similar Individual advancing results. Mainly, by participating in a parasitic collaboration with the very apparatus which helped craft the rational human, they helped pave the way for precarious undervalued labor conditions that have become standardized in the present.

                  For a captivating (but no way verifyable) exploration into the history of the California hippie movement, in which without ever explicitly saying, it is suggested that the movement was organized by the United States government as an attempt to quell anti-war protest, see McGowan, <i>Weird Scenes</i>. It is mostly a presentation of family relations that connect nearly all Laurel Canyon adjacent hippie-era musicians to high ranking military and intelligence officers. Which means either: yes it was all orchestrated; or, alternatively, the aforementioned military and intelligence officers simply genetically reproduced Individuals which impeccably advanced the system all on their own by perpetuating a movement which encouraged disconnecting from society and inward expression, even when they may have viewed their actions as subversive: <i>functional irrelevance</i>.

                  Finkelstein, "Military Memetics." In this PowerPoint, the potential of memes and memetics as a method of influence are discussed in great detail. Their propagation: number, type, and dispersion of recipients; their persistence: duration of transmission and presence in cultural memory; their <i>entropy</i>: how much information they contain, measured in “bits”; and  their impact: individual and social consequence. cf. Dean, <i>Communicative Capitalism</i>, 2. In which Jodi Dean describes <i>communicative capitalism</i> as “the materialization of ideals of inclusion and participation in information, entertainment, and communication technologies in ways that capture resistance and intensify global capitalism.” This very real observation of the perceived global stage of the internet being more akin to shouting into a void is worth acknowledging as a helpful advancement in viewing agency on the internet, especially as platforms continue to shrink, and we move increasingly online. However, the fact that abstract modes of internet communication have been researched by DARPA should show that at the very least: those which perpetuate The Individual believe memes have potential.

The scope of this concept is more interested in the ideology perpetrated by the pilots of this global apparatus and the way it shapes subjects than the apparatus itself; while undoubtedly, the Extra-State apparatus presents a readymade infrastructural network to use for the achievement and maintenance of ecologically minded transindividual collective flourishing.
